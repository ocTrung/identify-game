# identify-game

What:
A quiz game that tests your ability to identify games based on images.

Why:
I built this with the intention to learn Tailwind CSS and practice vanilla JavaScript and Git.

Interesting things:
- Choice of answers for each question is randomly generated from a list of included games in the quiz.
- Image sources are from IMGUR because they allow cross site origin requests.


Todo:
- add styling
- add play again button
