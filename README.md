# Video Game Quiz ðŸ‘¾

A quiz game that tests your ability to identify games based on images. This was built with the intention to learn Tailwind CSS and practice vanilla JavaScript and Git.

features:
- Choice of answers for each question is randomly generated from a list of included games in the quiz.
- Image sources are from IMGUR because they allow cross site origin requests.
- Feedback for correct/incorrect answers

## Lessons

- Since Tailwind works through templates, it would probably work better with a framework like React where you can simply write utility classes straight inside JSX.
- It's important to think about how your web app will look on multiple devices early on.
- Tailwind takes a mobile first approach. 

From the docs:

> What this means is that unprefixed utilities (like uppercase) take effect on all screen sizes, while prefixed utilities (like md:uppercase) only take effect at the specified breakpoint and above.
