# identify-game

What:
A quiz game that tests your ability to identify games based on images.

Why:
I built this with the intention to learn Tailwind CSS and practice vanilla JavaScript and Git.

Features:
- Choice of answers for each question is randomly generated from all possible games in the quiz.
- Choices are randomly sorted so the correct answer does not appear in the same position.

Todo:
- add styling
- add play again button
